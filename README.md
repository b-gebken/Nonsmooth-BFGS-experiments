Code for the reproduction of the numerical experiments shown in the preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03296

"Example_criticality" corresponds to Example 1, "Example_exploration" corresponds to Example 2, and "Example_restarts" corresponds to Example 3. For each example, running "script_computation.m" performs the experiment, saves the result and produces the plots shown in the article.
